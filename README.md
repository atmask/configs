# Configs
A repo containing my configs for tools in my workspaces


## Nvim
My nvim configurations. There are a couple of dependencies that need to be installed before using this configuration.

```bash
brew install neovim
brew install font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
brew install ripgrep
```
When using the configuration for the first time, run `:Lazy` and then 'I' in the modal to install all the plugins.

To authenticate Copilot you'll also need to run `:Copilot setup` and follow the instructions.
